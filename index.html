								I study transiting M dwarf exoplanets as a member of
								<a href="https://casa.colorado.edu/~bertathompson/" target="_blank"> Zach Berta-Thompson's</a>
								CU Boulder Exoplaneteers (CUBE) research group.
								<br><br>
								<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-tess" target="_blank">The Transiting Exoplanet
								Survey Satellite (TESS)</a>
								is surveying the 200,000 brightest and nearest stars in our galaxy,
								and I run a ground-based observing campaign to validate and characterize as many M
								dwarf exoplanets as I can, focusing on small planets at long periods.
								So far, I have contributed to the validation and characterization of LHS 3844b (Vanderspek+ 2019, the first M
								dwarf planet found by TESS), the LP 791-18 system (Crossfield+ 2019), and TOIs 122b and 237b
								(Waalkes+ 2021).

								<b>Teaching:</b><br>
								ASTR 3400: Astronomy Research Methods, Fall 2018
								<br>
								I was a TA and research mentor for this astronomy research methods course,
								which involved helping students understand the underlying principles of exoplanet
								science, and the research methods we use to study individual planets and
								planet populations. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b><br>
								The Sommers-Bausch Observatory at CU Boulder regularly has public observing nights
								which I, along with other members of my department, facilitate. My research advisor
								and I also use the SBO telescopes for exoplanet science and to provide a research
								experience to undergraduate students interested in exoplanets. As this program
								gains traction, our undergraduate researchers will soon be contributing meaningful
								results to the TESS followup effort.
