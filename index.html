								<b>Education:</b>
								<br>
								I graduated with my B.S. in Astronomy & Astrophysics and Physics from the
								University of Michigan in 2016. (U of M Astronomy: if you're reading this, hire me
								in 2-3 years for a post-doc!)<br>
								After leaving U of M, I began my PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I am now a 3rd year
								graduate student.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b><br>
								I find and characterize planets that orbit M Dwarf-class stars. Currently,
								I am part of the Ground Based Followup team for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).
								Using a global network of 1-m telescopes, I observe potential transiting exoplanets found by TESS.
								I am also interested in these planet's atmospheres, particularly in the evolution of atmospheres
								of planets which orbit M Dwarfs.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Other Interests:</b><br>
								When I'm not finding planets or dealing with other academic responsibilities,
								you might find me reading a book with a cup of coffee, working on my cooking skills,
								or hiking with my dog.

							</span>
							<p>
								I study transiting M dwarf exoplanets as a member of
								<a href="https://casa.colorado.edu/~bertathompson/"> Zach Berta-Thompson's</a>
								CU Boulder Exoplaneteers (CUBE) research group.
								<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-tess"> The Transiting Exoplanet
								Survey Satellite (TESS)</a>
								is currently surveying the 200,000 brightest and nearest stars in our galaxy,
								and I run a ground-based observing campaign to validate and characterize as many M
								dwarf exoplanets as I can, focusing on small planets at long periods.
								So far, I have contributed to the validation and characterization of LHS 3844b (Vanderspek+ 2019, the first M
								dwarf planet found by TESS) and both known planets in the LP 791-18 system (Crossfield+ 2019).

								</span>
								<br>
								One aspect of planets orbiting M Dwarfs which I find interesting is what types of atmospheres these planets
								have, and how those atmospheres evolve over time in response to high XUV flux from the stellar host.
								This relatively open question is very important to our understanding of habitability and of the overall dynamics
								of planetary atmospheres. I explored the UV environment and possible atmospheric escape
								from the planet GJ 1132b in my last project (Waalkes+ 2019).

								<b>Teaching:</b><br>
								ASTR 3400: Astronomy Research Methods, Fall 2018
								<br>
								I was a TA and research mentor for this astronomy research methods course,
								which involved helping students understand the underlying principles of exoplanet
								science, and the research methods we use to study individual planets and
								planet populations. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b><br>
								The Sommers-Bausch Observatory at CU Boulder regularly has public observing nights
								which I, along with other members of my department, facilitate. My research advisor
								and I also use the SBO telescopes for exoplanet science and to provide a research
								experience to undergraduate students interested in exoplanets. As this program
								gains traction, our undergraduate researchers will soon be contributing meaningful
								results to the TESS followup effort.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Equity & Inclusion:</b><br>
								Astronomy does not escape the inequalities and prejudices of our
								society. Because of this, we need to actively and constantly work to
								reduce barriers to access and eliminate exclusive practices.
								<br>
								<br>
								Rather than describe the ways I try to cultivate inclusivity, consider your own
								department/environment and what can be done to make it more inclusive. Do you still
								rely on standardized tests to choose applicants? Do admissions committee members take
								bias training? Do people in mentorship roles in your department reflect the diversity
								of your students?
								<br><br>
								There is always more work to do, and if you have found this page
								but have no idea what I'm talking about, one recommended starting point is the book
								Seeing White: An Introduction to White Privilege and Race.
