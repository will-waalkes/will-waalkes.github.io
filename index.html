								I study transiting M dwarf exoplanets and stellar activity as a member of
								<a href="https://casa.colorado.edu/~bertathompson/" target="_blank"> Zach Berta-Thompson's</a>
								CU Boulder Exoplaneteers (CUBE) research group. My work has included ground-based discovery and
								characterization of transiting exoplanets, stellar characterization, space-based spectroscopy of
								exoplanet atmospheres, and the study of starspots and their contaminating effects on exoplanet
								transmission spectra.

							</span>
							<p>
								Following the launch of TESS, I led a ground-based followup
								campaign using the Las Cumbres
								Observatory global network to confirm or rule out planet
								candidates. The first transit I observed was of ultra-short
								period M dwarf
								exoplanet LHS 3844b (Vanderspek+ 2019),
								which became the first published rocky exoplanet found by TESS.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								My observations have led or contributed to several other
								discoveries of M dwarf exoplanets like
								<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2023/05/17/newly-discovered-planet-size-earth-may-be-covered-volcanoes" target="_blank">
									the nearby Earth-sized planet LP 791-18 d</a> (Peterson+ 2023)
								and the earlier discovery of planets LP 791-18 b and c
								(Crossfield+ 2019),
								the TOI 2096 system (Pozuelos+ 2023), and
								the sub-Neptunes TOIs 122b and 237b (Waalkes+ 2021).
								Each of these worlds is a viable candidate for
								atmospheric characterization with current or
								near-future observational instruments.
							</p>
							
							<span class = "image main">
								<img src="" alt=""/>
							</span>
							<p>
								Exoplanet atmospheres are difficult to detect and characterize,
								and one way to search for them is by looking for atmospheric outflow of
								hydrogen from sub-Neptune exoplanets that orbit close to
								active host stars. I looked for evidence of neutral hydrogen
								outflow from rocky exoplanet GJ 1132b (Berta+ 2013).
